## Description

This project is a simple and user-friendly web-based translator, designed to provide an easy way to translate text between different languages using a clean, distraction-free interface. The idea came from my personal need to switch between languages during daily tasks like writing, studying, or chatting online, and I wanted to create a solution that is fast, simple, and free of ads or unnecessary features.

The translator was built using Python and the Flask framework, along with HTML and CSS to create a modern and responsive design. While it does not use any external APIs, the translation logic is handled internally using custom logic and text replacement. The layout was carefully designed to be minimalistic, using a black and white color scheme and responsive styling for both desktop and mobile devices.

This project demonstrates my ability to use Flask for backend routing and form handling, as well as my skills in frontend design. It‚Äôs a full-stack project built completely from scratch, and represents what I‚Äôve learned throughout the CS50 course. It may look simple, but it includes many important concepts like templating, user interaction, form submissions, and page rendering. I'm proud of how it turned out and hope it serves as a useful tool and a strong final submission for the course.

## Cause

This project was created as part of my final submission for Harvard's CS50 course. Throughout the course, I learned the fundamentals of computer science, programming logic, and full-stack web development. I wanted to apply all the skills I had gained into something that feels practical, personal, and useful.

I decided to build a simple translation website. The idea came from my daily struggles switching between languages while studying, writing, or communicating with others. I often found existing translation platforms either too complex, slow, full of ads, or designed with interfaces that were difficult to use. I wanted to build something for myself and others who need fast, distraction-free, and easy-to-use translation tools.

What makes this project special is its simplicity. It doesn‚Äôt rely on external APIs or complex backend systems. Instead, it focuses on giving users a smooth, clean interface where they can input text and get a translated version through simple built-in functionality. The site follows a black and white modern design to keep the user focused only on what matters: the content.

The cause behind this project is more than just utility. I wanted to prove to myself that I could build a complete, functional, and visually clean web application from scratch. I also wanted to challenge myself to create something responsive that works well across different devices, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and Flask.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of routing in Flask, how to handle forms and POST requests, how to manage user sessions, and how to structure clean and scalable templates. I also focused on design ‚Äî ensuring that fonts, spacing, and layout feel modern and comfortable.

This translator may not be powered by a fancy engine or artificial intelligence, but it is the result of many hours of learning, debugging, designing, and iterating. I‚Äôm proud of it because it represents my personal journey throughout CS50 ‚Äî from knowing very little about programming to building something that others can actually use.

Creating this project taught me how powerful even the most basic tools can be when used creatively. It reminded me that you don‚Äôt need hundreds of libraries or frameworks to solve a problem ‚Äî sometimes, a clean idea and simple design are enough. This is why I built this translator. This is why I chose this cause.

### üí° What is this project?

This web app allows users to input any text and get instant translations using googletrans. The goal was to make something functional **but also clean and modern** in design ‚Äî not just a boring input/output form.

Users can:
- Type in any text
- Choose the target language
- Get a real-time translation instantly
- (And secretly admire the minimal black-and-white UI ‚ú®)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

- **Flask** ‚Äì the backend framework used to serve routes and logic
- **HTML/CSS** ‚Äì for the frontend structure and styling
- **Jinja** ‚Äì for templating and dynamic rendering
- **SQL** ‚Äì to log or store some translation history (if implemented)
